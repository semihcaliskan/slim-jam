## About Project

Slim Jam is a demo application to provide examples for composer package, PHPSpreadsheet, Shopify API etc. usages.

This project aims to take an Excel file from user, parse it and save each product from each row to projects own database. Then read that data and import each product to Shopify through their API.

To achive this first we need to install phpoffice/phpspreadsheet package to read data from Excel file. We want to translate some strings from English to other languages, so we need to install google/cloud-translate package. This one needs API keys from Google Cloud. Lastly; we need to send those data to shopify, so we will install shopify/shopify-api

    A web page asks for an Excel file
    User uploads an Excel file from that form
    System reads Excel, saves each row
    Import those data to Shopify
